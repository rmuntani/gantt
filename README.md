# Gantt chart in React

This simple application implements Gantt chart using React.

It was implemented with React 16.8.6, with tests written with Jest and Enzyme.

React is *probably* not the best framework to use to write such component, but it 
the process of implementing this chart was used as a learning resource.


# Scripts

This application follows the concepts of [Scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all). Docker is required to run the tests and bundle the required codes.
